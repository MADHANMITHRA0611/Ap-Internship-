# 🌟 INTERMEDIATE HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT – TASK 2  
📁 PROJECT REPOSITORY  
🧠 A hands-on project combining responsive design, real-time validation, and JavaScript interactivity.


## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project was developed as part of my frontend development training at **ApexPlanet Software Pvt Ltd**. It showcases my understanding of HTML structure, CSS responsiveness, and JavaScript-based interactivity. Each component—from form validation to layout and dynamic functionality—was built with a focus on usability and user experience. 🖥️✨

> 💬 “A well-crafted interface isn’t just functional—it’s intuitive, responsive, and dynamic.”


## 🧩 CORE OBJECTIVES

### 1️⃣ **CONTACT FORM USING HTML & CSS**
Build a clean and accessible form with input types like text, email, and submit buttons. Styled the form layout using flexbox and CSS to enhance visual clarity.

### 2️⃣ **FORM VALIDATION WITH JAVASCRIPT**
Added JavaScript validation to check required fields and email format. Provided real-time feedback to users for better UX and data accuracy. 🧠✅

### 3️⃣ **RESPONSIVE LAYOUT WITH FLEXBOX & GRID**
Used CSS Grid for content and Flexbox for navigation to make the layout responsive. Applied media queries to adjust layout across screen sizes. 📱🧱

### 4️⃣ **TO-DO LIST WITH DOM MANIPULATION**
Created a dynamic to-do list where users can add and delete tasks using JavaScript. Applied DOM manipulation to render tasks in real time. 🔄📋
