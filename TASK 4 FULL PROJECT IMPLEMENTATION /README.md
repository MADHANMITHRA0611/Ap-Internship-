## 🛍️ Product Listing Page with Filtering & Sorting

A fully responsive, dynamic web application that simulates a basic e-commerce interface. Built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, this project demonstrates key front-end development concepts such as data-driven UI updates, DOM manipulation, and client-side filtering and sorting—all without any external frameworks or libraries.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is part of a broader web development training task focusing on full project implementation using core web technologies.

The goal was to develop an interactive product catalog that allows users to:

View a list of available products.

Filter products based on categories.

Sort products based on price or rating.

Experience a clean and intuitive responsive UI across all devices.


It mimics real-world e-commerce behavior and is ideal for understanding how front-end logic can be structured and optimized in single-page applications.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

✅ Combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a fully interactive product page.

✅ Use event listeners to trigger filtering and sorting functions dynamically.

✅ Implement responsive design principles using flexible layouts and media queries.

✅ Ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience across various screen sizes and devices.

✅ Use JavaScript arrays and objects to represent and manipulate product data dynamically.
