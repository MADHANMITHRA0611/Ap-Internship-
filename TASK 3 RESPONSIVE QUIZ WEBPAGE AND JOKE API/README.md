🌟🌟 ADVANCED STYLING & JAVASCRIPT – TASK 3🌟🌟

📁 PROJECT REPOSITORY

🧠 A creative and interactive front-end task using advanced CSS and JavaScript — including quizzes, live API data, and responsive design.


---

🔗 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project is part of my front-end development internship at ApexPlanet Software Pvt Ltd. It demonstrates how I applied JavaScript logic, CSS responsiveness, and API integration to build real-time, interactive components.

From DOM manipulation to API calls, each part was built with usability and responsiveness in mind. 🌐✨

💬 “Great web experiences aren't just designed — they're built with interaction, feedback, and responsiveness in mind.”

🔗 🧩 CORE OBJECTIVES

1️⃣ RESPONSIVE DESIGN WITH MEDIA QUERIES

Used CSS media queries to make the layout adapt across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. Styled using Flexbox and Grid to maintain clean visual hierarchy.

2️⃣ INTERACTIVE QUIZ USING JAVASCRIPT

Built a functional Quiz App that tracks answers, gives feedback, and allows users to restart the quiz. Leveraged event listeners, arrays, and conditional logic. 🧠✅

3️⃣ LIVE JOKE GENERATOR USING JOKEAPI

Used fetch() and async/await to pull random jokes from 🔗 JokeAPI and display them dynamically. Added error handling, loading states, and formatting for both single-line and two-part jokes. 😂🌐


---

🔗 🧠 KEY LEARNINGS

Strengthened understanding of DOM manipulation

Applied async JavaScript to work with real APIs

Built modular, reusable functions for quizzes and data rendering

Practiced responsive layout design with media queries

Enhanced UX through loading indicators, feedback messages, and conditional logic ✨


💬 "Interactivity turns static pages into real experiences — and JavaScript is the magic behind it."

🔗 🚀 FINAL DELIVERABLES

✔️ Responsive layout using media queries
✔️ Interactive multi-question quiz with scoring
✔️ Live joke generator integrated with JokeAPI
✔️ Modular, scalable project structure with clean code
