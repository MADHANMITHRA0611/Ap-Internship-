🌟🌟 **ADVANCED STYLING & JAVASCRIPT – TASK 3**🌟🌟

🔗 📁 **PROJECT REPOSITORY**

🧠 A practical collection of 3 mini-projects showcasing responsive design, JavaScript interactivity, and real-time API integration using core frontend technologies. 💻🌐✨


---

🔗 🎯 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

Built during my frontend development training at 🏢 ApexPlanet Software Pvt Ltd, this task focused on transforming UI concepts into real-world, interactive web modules.

Each project demonstrates modern layout techniques, DOM-based interactivity, and live API-driven content, all structured with scalable, mobile-first code. 🚀📲

> 💬 “The frontend isn’t just about pixels—it’s about creating living, breathing experiences.” 🎨🧬

🔗 🧩 **CORE OBJECTIVES**

✅ **1. RESPONSIVE DESIGN MODULE 📱**

Built adaptive layouts using CSS Flexbox, Grid, and media queries for cross-device compatibility.

✅ **2. INTERACTIVE QUIZ OR CAROUSEL 🧠**

Implemented dynamic UI components like a quiz app or image carousel using JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and event listeners.

✅ **3. API INTEGRATION PROJECT 🌐**

Fetched and rendered real-time data using public APIs such as JokeAPI and OpenWeather, utilizing fetch(), async/await, and loading/error handling logic.
